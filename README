GKSu README

* Home Page

GKSu is hosted at Savannah! Check http://www.nongnu.org/gksu out.

* Configuration

If you're upgrading from a version lower than 1.3.2, you might have
used the /etc/gksu.conf file to setup gksu's behavior. From that version
on gksu uses mateconf for its configuration. There's a script called
gksu-migrate-conf.sh which can be used to setup the mateconf system according
to your old config file setup. Just run it with the configuration file
as its first argument.

The script will be located in ${datadir}/gksu. On 'usual' instalations
that would be /usr/share/gksu or /usr/local/share/gksu.

Notice that the mateconf stuff has been moved to libgksu since the 1.9.x
development series.

See gksu(1) for details.

* BUGS

Please report bugs directly to my email address, or through the
Savannahs's BTS. If you are using the Debian package feel free
to use the Debian BTS.
